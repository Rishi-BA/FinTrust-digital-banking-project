# FinTrust Digital Banking Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the **complete business analysis documentation** for FinTrust Bank’s transition from branch-only operations to a **24x7 digital banking platform**.  
It demonstrates the **full BA project lifecycle** — from requirements gathering to solution design — including BRD, FRD, user stories, wireframes, and process flows.

## 🏦 Problem Statement
Currently, FinTrust Bank only serves customers in physical branches, requiring in-person visits for:
- New account registration
- Balance inquiries
- Fund transfers
- Transaction details requests

This leads to:
- High operational costs
- Long queues and poor customer experience
- Customers moving to digital-first banks

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
Create a **customer-facing online banking platform** to:
- Provide 24x7 account access
- Enable profile, account, and fund management
- Integrate with the bank’s core banking and authentication systems
- Reduce in-branch workload and improve customer experience
